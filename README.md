# PrizePicks Pokedex

## Overview

This project should take approximately 2+ hours to complete and help PrizePicks assess your front end knowledge and development style.

If you find the project takes longer than you’d like please submit a functional version of what you have. We're interested in assessing a functioning project even if all of the business requirements are not implemented.

## The Problem

Ash and his friends are on a new adventure to catch even more Pokemon! Before they set off on this journey they need some tools. As we all know every great Pokemon trainer needs a reliable Pokedex to identify Pokemon. It’s a good thing they have you! Ash has asked if you would be willing to build him a brand new Pokedex with core features and a couple of enhancements.

## Business Requirements

- Use the Pokemon API to make API requests for data https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.
